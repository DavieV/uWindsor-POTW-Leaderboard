About
---------

Each week the Computer Science Society comes up with a new computer science related problem dubbed the "Problem of the week."

Students who solve said problem recieve a ballot that is entered for a draw at the end of the month where you could win some pretty sweet prizes.

This web-app was created to help make the process easier for all those involved (solvers and checkers) and hopefully get more students involved.

Find a bug in my code?  Think of a sweet feature? Awesome!  Fork this repo and make a merge request.  If you aren't super familiar with django come find me in the java lab and talk to me about it!

TODO
--------

* More attractive homepage
* Better error checking / messages
* Dropdowns for years and weeks depending on the currently released problems
* Student profile customisation
* Contact students based on their profile (maybe make this toggleable)
* Hilarious professor related 404 pages (integral part of any website)
* Automatic code checking? (Probably not)
